# Outstanding research questions (ramblings)

Function of LOC? Do the two cell populations performdifferent tasks? Yes, but why different lengths and group innervation?
What changes occur to synaptic strength at the single cell level due to LTP-inducing shock?
Are non-lemniscal thalamic nuclei primarily driven by descending cortical inputs?
Cochlea IHC oversampling and encoding before bifucating in CN (Type I terminate solely in CN).

Three CN pathways:
- Vertical sound localisation (IC)
- Horizontal sound localisation (SO)
- Pattern recognition (VNLL)

Three CN divisions:
- AVCN
- PVCN
- DCN

Leads to:
- Inferior Colliculus and TB (LN & VN)
- Cortex (many areas recruited)
- Corticocollicular feedback with high excitatory populations 

Medial OC neurons in MSO & feedback to OHCs over a wide area of cochlea.
Endbulb anatomical differences w.r.t. neurotransmitter population flow/distribution? Temporal smoothing within dendrites and synaptic placement? Potentially (saturation?) related to spontateous rate SR?
DCN similar layered structure to cerebellum.
Surrounding the core SOC nuclei are peri-olivary nuclei (PON) that are mostly inhibitory.
Non-neuronal cochlear Deiters and Henson cells? (Fechner FP et al., 1998, 229: 432-450)
Corticofungal selective attention and monitoring to enhance auditory signals.

Hearing is closer to touch? (as far as comparing sensory encoding?)
