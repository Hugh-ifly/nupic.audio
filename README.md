Auditory experiments using [cortical learning algorithms](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=cortical+learning+algorithms&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ei=fYM6VZHVMIfqaIPcgNAI&ved=0CB4QgQMwAA) (CLA) and [hierarchical temporal memory](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=hierarchical+temporal+memory&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ei=1IM6Vfy6AZKO7AbSnYDgAQ&sqi=2&ved=0CB4QgQMwAA) (HTM).

## Repositories of interest

- Numenta's [nupic.critic](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.critic) Audio streaming
- [NuMozart](https://github.com/passiweinberger/NuMozart) Digital (MIDI) streaming and composition
- [HTMforGenreClassification](https://github.com/nupic.community/nupic.audio/HTMforGenreClassification) Genre classification
- Hackathon scripts and data for [Musenta](https://github.com/jinpan/Musenta)

_Note:_ These repositories currently are all deemed to be work-in-progress.

## Areas of investigation

- Genre/Style classification
- Harmonic/transient analysis
- Music composition
- Echo location and spatial positioning
- Stream segmentation and seperation (selective attention)
- IC processing (differing STRFs)
- Cochleotopic mapping
- Cortical pathways and projections
- 'What' and 'Where'
- Dendritic micro-circuits and synaptic placement (wrt soma distance)
- Auditory nerve spike firing (IHC to CN GBC integrator cells)
- Motion derivative encoding (in the time-frequency domain)
- Spike-timing dependent plasticity (LTP and LTD shadowing).

An alternative for the encoding of audio signals is modelling of the _**spike firing of auditory-nerve fibers**_. A collection of models can be found in the EarLab @ Boston University (http://earlab.bu.edu/ See Modelling -> Downloadable Models).
